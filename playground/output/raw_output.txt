    "disaster_analysis": "A massive solar flare (X10) struck Earth on November 1, 2025, at 16:00 UTC, causing a geomagnetic storm that hit 8 billion people across the globe with a 48-hour storm surge.",
    "event_summary": "A solar flare disrupted satellites in China, Russia, and the United States, killing 3,000 and knocking down 1,000 flights.",
    "detailed_analysis": "The flare's X10 strength killed 3,000 at 16:00 UTC, affecting 8 billion, with 48 hours' damage including satellite outages and power failures. Weather conditions were neutral with no storm surge, impacting cities from Beijing to London.",
    "predictions": "Satellite outages and power cuts continue over China, Russian cities, and the U.S., while raw data remains unreliable as solar activity drops.",
    "impacts": "Media coverage was halted; 1,000 flights canceled, and 50 satellites fell, affecting 8,000,000 homes and 300,000 injured.",
    "mitigation_strategies": "Covered solar panels, invest in grid resilience, and recommend backup generators.",
    "recommendations": "Stop utilities early, deploy shelters, and buy insurance for 8 million homes."
